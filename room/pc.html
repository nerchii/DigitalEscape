            <p> Hello hello, imma flex my beautiful creation. I've never really had a nice PC before, had one from like 2007 until now, lmao, and since it was SLOWWWW I mostly used only my laptop. Last year I started building this beautiful piece of machine, absolutely love it. Accidentally found a second-hand motherboard on Vinted for 30 euros, it's not the most powerful, but it was a huge upgrade from my old PC. Additionally, found a second-hand AMD Radeon™ RX 570, bought a cool PC case and RAM. Unfortunately, one of the RAM slots on the motherboard is broken, but for now, 16 gigs is okay for what I use my PC for. </p>

            <p>I used to draw a lot, got a Wacom Cintiq Pro 13, excellent tablet. It's discontinued now, but I got mine second-hand. It's not huge, but it's a good-sized screen tablet. Not the most portable since you have to connect it with like 4 cables and it disconnects easily. The parallax on this thing is excellent; the tip of the pen touches the cursor.
                Also, can't express how helpful having a remote like the Wacom Express Key Remote is. I got mine with my tablet, probably wouldn’t get one otherwise cuz it's 100 euros bruh, but it is so helpful and not just for drawing. You can program buttons for specific apps, so you can use it for video editing, games, or other stuff you need.</p>

            <p>Krita is a really good free open-source drawing program, with a lot of free assets online. It’s similar to Photoshop. Maybe the learning curve is a little steep, but once you learn how to use it, it’s great. I’d say it’s by far one of the best drawing software out there. Procreate is also awesome but you gotta own an iPad, and it’s not free like Krita. I've used Krita for like 95% of the drawings I have posted, AND by far the besttttt brushes <a href="https://krita-artists.org/t/rakurri-brush-set-v2-free-krita-brushes/33709">Rakurri brush set v2</a>
                , especially "Rushbrush", ughh so good.</p>
